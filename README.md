## 📦 Installation
The extension can be installed from the Chrome Web Store [here][1].

If you wish to build yourself, `build.sh` is used to copy all files to the `build/` directory, compile css, and zip the extension. You can do this any other way you wish. [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) is used for CSS compilation. After running `build.sh`, the build directory can be loaded into Chrome.


## 🕹️ Usage
Select a block of text on any site, right click, and choose `Tally Word Counter: Count` in the context menu. The number of characters, words, sentences, paragraphs, spaces, letters, digits, and special characters will be shown.
